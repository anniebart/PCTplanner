## A web app to help you plan your hike of the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://www.pcta.org/).

### What is the Pacific Crest Trail?
The Pacific Crest Trail, or PCT as it commonly called, is a 2650 mile trail spanning from the Mexican-US border in California to the Canadian-US border in Washington.

Climbing up to heights of over 13,000 feet, it's by no means a walk in the park. From the Sierra Nevadas to the Cascades, the dry deserts of southern California to the peaks of Washington, the trail goes through vastly different terrains and requires adaption and flexibility by the hiker. 

Many who attempt to complete the hike in one go (dubbed Thru-hikers), do not finish, whether from injury, discomfort or natural disasters like the fires we saw this year.

It requires a huge amount of planning, which is why I decided to build this app, to make it just a little bit easier for each hiker. 

I have yet to hike the PCT, but I hope to one day add my name to the [2600 miler list](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/thru-hiking-long-distance-hiking/2600-miler-list/).
